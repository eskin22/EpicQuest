# Documentation of what styling I chose for aspects of the game.
## Lore = For now it is white with no background. Bold text throughout. 
- This may change depending on how it looks. I think I may want the lore to stand out more. For now, the lore at the beginning of the the game/each room/each level, will just be a simple black background with white text.
## Character Stats/Inventory = White background with black text. The style should be in brihgt for everything but the header. 
- Right now there is no inventory, just the character stats. I really like how the white box looks with the character stats. I will be using this methodology from now on. Potentially make this function more basic, so it can be reused. 
- Important to make the header a different color than black to make it stand out. Right now the Player Info header is green. Inventory may be different to distinguish between the 2. For right now though, I think it is okay if the header's for both are green. 
## User Input == The question is bolded and in green with no background. If there are options, they are unbolded and should be in different colors. 
- There may not always be options, such as when the user is asked to enter there name. 
- If options do exist, they should be different color than green.
