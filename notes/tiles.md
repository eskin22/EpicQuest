# This is to track the different tiles in the game.

## Empty Tile 
- This tile is empty. The player has an option to move. 

## Enemy Tile
- This tile contains an enemy that I specify.
- Right now the player automatically engage in combat. 
- Once the Inventory class is in place. I want to give the players an option to access their inventory. 

## Chest Tile 
- This tile is a chest.
- Some chests will be open, the player can automatically open it
- A subclass of chest will be the locked chests. A player may have to solve a riddle or a math problem. Not sure yet. 

## Table Tile 
- This tile is a table.
- Works similar to the chest tile. The player will not have an option to open though, but an option to search. 
- Can add these items to their inventory. 

## Pages/Notes file
- Still not exactly sure what I want this to be. 
- The plan is to have a tile contain a note/letter/page ripped out of book, that will give the user lore of the game, while also being potential helpul answers to riddles and puzzles in the game.
